              <p class="card-text">As artists, we are often told to take every opportunity that comes
                our way. You never know who could be in attendance at that next
                gallery opening, what connections you will find at that event, or
                what could lead to future opportunities. But, sometimes, it’s less
                about saying “yes” and more about knowing what’s ok to give up.
                Habits, as you likely know if you were ever a nail-biter, can be
                incredibly hard to break. The invisible mental habits of ours can be
                even more difficult to overcome, but because of this, even more
                important. So, give yourself permission to quit these things. And,
                give yourself the time and patience to break the habits.

                better at some things than other people, and worse at other things.
                Dwelling on either isn’t going to get you anywhere. It can stifle
                your creativity as an emerging artist to compare yourself to someone
                who is twenty years into their career, and it can stunt your growth
                to compare your work to someone who is just starting out. Instead of
                focusing on how you stack up next to someone else, invest that
                energy into comparing your recent work with the work you made six
                months ago, a year ago and five years ago. Have you grown? And where
                do you want to see yourself six months, a year, and five years in
                the future?

                Koons did that! I mean there are so many pathways. The traditional
                route of only working with galleries is a good option if they really
                care about your work, but there are so many outlets now. You could
                also work in an arts-related field like graphic designer, architect,
                it's your life and it's short so might as well do whatever you want
                and make all your dreams come true! It's up to you anyways. I mean
                Buddha and Jesus and Warhol are just people like us we can strive to
                be as powerful and magic as we want!

                <p class="card-text">The Art of Painting, also known as The Allegory of Painting, or
                  Painter in his Studio, is a 17th-century oil on canvas painting by
                  Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. It is owned by the Austrian Republic
                  and is on display in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.[1] This
                  illusionistic painting is one of Vermeer's most famous. In 1868
                  Thoré-Bürger, known today for his rediscovery of the work of painter
                  Johannes Vermeer, regarded this painting as his most interesting.
                  Svetlana Alpers describes it as unique and ambitious.

                  of Nature is a unique opportunity to host fascinating stories of
                  scientific investigation through selected works from the Museum's

                  gaining an appreciation of how natural history artists’ techniques,
                  and how their pieces became increasingly scientifically accurate.

                <p class="card-text">A mandala represents the universe that is beyond one’s
                  consciousness. It is a symbol of wholeness. In one way it can be
                  seen as a cosmic diagram that reminds us of our relation to the
                  infinite, the world that exists both beyond and within our body and
                  mind. The ‘’circle with a center’’ represents the basic pattern of
                  creation. From micro to macro, biology to geology, chemistry to
                  astronomy, it embodies everything. Some cultures believe that
                  Mandalas are everywhere in nature-from the structure of cells to the
                  earth and the universe. If you look closely at a Mandala, you will
                  find a center with outward radiating patterns, which symbolizes
                  one’s innermost potential and self-expression.
