          <h1>Be Creative</h1>
          <p>
            As artists, we are often told to take every opportunity that comes
            our way. You never know who could be in attendance at that next
            gallery opening, what connections you will find at that event, or
            what could lead to future opportunities. But, sometimes, it’s less
            about saying “yes” and more about knowing what’s ok to give up.
            Habits, as you likely know if you were ever a nail-biter, can be
            incredibly hard to break. The invisible mental habits of ours can be
            even more difficult to overcome, but because of this, even more
            important. So, give yourself permission to quit these things. And,
            give yourself the time and patience to break the habits.

          <h2>Give up comparisons</h2>
          <p>
            Here’s the thing about comparisons: you are always going to be
            better at some things than other people, and worse at other things.
            Dwelling on either isn’t going to get you anywhere. It can stifle
            your creativity as an emerging artist to compare yourself to someone
            who is twenty years into their career, and it can stunt your growth
            to compare your work to someone who is just starting out. Instead of
            focusing on how you stack up next to someone else, invest that
            energy into comparing your recent work with the work you made six
            months ago, a year ago and five years ago. Have you grown? And where
            do you want to see yourself six months, a year, and five years in
            the future?
          </p>
          <p>Only compare yourself to yourself.</p>

          <p>
            Who cares you can work on Wall Street and then switch to art! Jeff
            Koons did that! I mean there are so many pathways. The traditional
            route of only working with galleries is a good option if they really
            care about your work, but there are so many outlets now. You could
            also work in an arts-related field like graphic designer, architect,
            it's your life and it's short so might as well do whatever you want
            and make all your dreams come true! It's up to you anyways. I mean
            Buddha and Jesus and Warhol are just people like us we can strive to
            be as powerful and magic as we want!

          <h4>The Art of Painting</h4>
          <p>
            The Art of Painting, also known as The Allegory of Painting, or
            Painter in his Studio, is a 17th-century oil on canvas painting by
            Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. It is owned by the Austrian Republic
            and is on display in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.[1] This
            illusionistic painting is one of Vermeer's most famous. In 1868
            Thoré-Bürger, known today for his rediscovery of the work of painter
            Johannes Vermeer, regarded this painting as his most interesting.
            Svetlana Alpers describes it as unique and ambitious;[2] Walter
            Liedtke "as a virtuoso display of the artist's power of invention
            and execution, staged in an imaginary version of his studio ..."[3]
            According to Albert Blankert "No other painting so flawlessly
            integrates naturalistic technique, brightly illuminated space, and a
            complexly integrated composition.

          <h6>Mandala Art</h6>
          <p>
            A mandala represents the universe that is beyond one’s
            consciousness. It is a symbol of wholeness. In one way it can be
            seen as a cosmic diagram that reminds us of our relation to the
            infinite, the world that exists both beyond and within our body and
            mind. The ‘’circle with a center’’ represents the basic pattern of
            creation. From micro to macro, biology to geology, chemistry to
            astronomy, it embodies everything. Some cultures believe that
            Mandalas are everywhere in nature-from the structure of cells to the
            earth and the universe. If you look closely at a Mandala, you will
            find a center with outward radiating patterns, which symbolizes
            one’s innermost potential and self-expression.
